EDWARD T. ROSTICK

Edward has been licensed to practice law in Pennsylvania since
1980\. He was born and raised in Philadelphia,
and attended Temple University as an undergraduate, and then the Temple School of Law (now the Beasley School of Law), which has
long been nationally renowned for its training of trial lawyers
and advocates.

He began his legal career as a law clerk and then attorney
at a mid-sized Philadelphia
law firm handling complex ligation on behalf of major corporations
and insurance companies. Having always had the goal of running
his own law practice, in 1997 he established his firm, located within
easy access to center city Philadelphia and the surrounding county seats.His extensive background
in litigation provides him with not only 36 years of experience
trying cases - it also provides him with important knowledge
as to what can be done in advance to prevent many problems from
becoming disputes.
